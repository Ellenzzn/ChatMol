Mosedipimod is a synthetic version of a monoacetyldiacylglyceride naturally occurring in various seed oils, bovine udder and milk fat, antlers of sika deer, with potential antineoplastic activity. Although the exact mechanism of action through which it exerts its pharmacological effect has yet to be fully identified, upon administration, mosedipimod stimulates calcium influx into T-lymphocytes and increases the production of various cytokines, including interleukin (IL) -2, IL-4, IL-12, interferon-gamma (IFN-g), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells and immune cells, including T- and B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. Therefore, EC18 may stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. In addition, it enhances the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and suppresses the expression of the transmembrane protein tumor cell toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) on cancer cells.

Upon intramuscular administration, it is able to induce the expression of PR in endometrial cancer. This could increase the sensitivity of endometrial cancer cells to progestin monotherapy. In combination with a progestin, cancer cells could be eradicated through increased PR-mediated signaling, leading to an inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) release from the pituitary gland, via a negative feedback mechanism, and, eventually, an inhibition of estrogen release from the ovaries. This leads to an inhibition of cellular growth in estrogen-dependent tumor cells. In addition, this agent is able to increase the production and release of interferon (IFN) alpha and beta. PR is often downregulated in endometrial cancer and makes it resistant to progestin-mediated hormone therapy.

Upon oral administration, calcifediol is taken up by the body and converted, in the kidneys, to the active form calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or 1,25(OH)2D). This form increases and normalizes vitamin D plasma levels, which, in turn, regulates calcium plasma levels, and normalizes elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels by suppressing both PTH synthesis, and secretion. Vitamin D modulates and enhances the innate and adaptive immune responses. This may improve unregulated inflammation and prevents the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Specifically, vitamin D binds to its receptor vitamin D receptor (VDR) which is widely expressed on immune cells and epithelial cells. This stimulates neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, and activates epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).

The structure of it was established via appending hydroxylaminobutyric acid to [DB12604] at position 1 and 2-hydroxyethyl group at position 6'. It was designed to evade all clinically relevant aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, which contribute to the main resistance mechanism for aminoglycoside therapy. However, acquired resistance of aminoglycosides may arise through over expression of efflux pumps and ribosomal modification by bacteria, which results from amino acid or rRNA sequence mutations. Like other aminoglycosides, it is ineffective against bacterial isolates that produce 16S rRNA methyltransferases. it mediates the antibacterial activity against pathogens including carbapenem-resistant (CRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. It mediates the antibacterial activity by binding to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein synthesis.

13344	COCCOCCN(CC(=O)NCCCCCCOP(=O)(O)O)C(=O)COCCOC	it is a proprietary 44-nucleotide L-stereoisomer RNA oligonucleotide conjugated to a 40 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) that targets hepcidin with potential anti-anemic activity. Upon intravenous or subcutaneous administration, lexaptepid pegol binds to hepcidin and prevents it from binding to the iron channel ferroportin, located on the basolateral surface of gastrointestinal enterocytes and the plasma membrane of macrophages. This prevents hepcidin-induced internalization and degradation of ferroportin, thus decreasing macrophage iron retention. In turn, binding of NOX-H94 to hepcidin normalizes plasma iron levels and increases erythropoiesis. This may inhibit anemia caused by inflammation. Hepcidin, a peptide hormone that plays a key role in the homeostasis of systemic iron, is upregulated during acute and chronic inflammation in response to cytokines. The unique mirror-image configuration of this agent renders it resistant to hydrolysis and shows a low antigenicity profile. Pegylation increases the half-life of this agent. it is a 45-mer L-stereoisomer RNA oligonucleotide linked to a 40 kDa polyethyleneglycol that targets the small chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) with potential antineoplastic and hematopoietic stem cell-mobilization activities. SDF-1 targeted agent NOX-A12 specifically binds to SDF-1 thereby preventing the binding of SDF-1 to its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 blocking the subsequent receptor activation. This may prevent angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis and could sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy. In addition, inhibition of SDF-1/CXCR4 interaction may induce mobilization of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow into blood. The unique mirror-image configuration of this agent renders it resistant to hydrolysis and does not hybridize with native nucleic acids. Furthermore, this agent does not induce the innate immune response and has shown a favorable immunogenicity profile.

Upon administration of etirinotecan pegol (EP), the agent penetrates into the leaky tumor vasculature and accumulates in the tumor. The linker slowly hydrolyzes and releases irinotecan, which leads to sustained exposure of the tumor to irinotecan. In turn, irinotecan is converted to the biologically active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38) by a carboxylesterase. SN38 inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the cleavable complex of topoisomerase I and DNA; this results in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptosis. Pegylation provides improved systemic exposure, increases drug penetration into tumors and decreases drug clearance, thereby increasing the duration of therapeutic effects while lowering the toxicity profile.

14851	C=CN1CCCC1=O	Polyvinylpyrrolidone is a white powder. Compatible with a wide range of hydrophilic and hydrophobic resins. (NTP, 1992) Povidone-Iodine is an iodophor solution containing a water-soluble complex of iodine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with broad microbicidal activity. Free iodine, slowly liberated from the polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine (PVPI) complex in solution, kills eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells through iodination of lipids and oxidation of cytoplasmic and membrane compounds. This agent exhibits a broad range of microbicidal activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Slow release of iodine from the PVPI complex in solution minimizes iodine toxicity towards mammalian cells. 
14852	CCC(=O)N(C1CCN(CC1)CCC2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3.Cl	it is the hydrochloride salt form of fentanyl, a synthetic, lipophilic phenylpiperidine opioid agonist with analgesic and anesthetic properties. Fentanyl selectively binds to the mu-receptor in the central nervous system (CNS) thereby mimicking the effects of endogenous opiates. Stimulation of the mu-subtype opioid receptor stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex and subsequently inhibits adenylate cyclase. This results in a decrease in intracellular cAMP and leads to a reduction in the release of neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline. The analgesic effect of fentanyl is likely due to its metabolite morphine, which induces opening of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels and blocks the opening of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels, thereby resulting in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.

Inhibition of WEE1 activity prevents the phosphorylation of CDC2 and impairs the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. This may lead to apoptosis upon treatment with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53 deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment of the G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53 deficient tumor cells more vulnerable to antineoplastic agents and enhance their cytotoxic effect.

(NTP, 1992) Vincristine Sulfate is the sulfate salt of a natural alkaloid isolated from the plant Catharanthus roseus (Vinca rosea L.) with antimitotic and antineoplastic activities. Vincristine binds irreversibly to microtubules and spindle proteins in S phase of the cell cycle and interferes with the formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby arresting tumor cells in metaphase. This agent also depolymerizes microtubules and may also interfere with amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism; calmodulin-dependent Ca(2+)-activated ATPase activity; cellular respiration; and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. 
14995	CC(C)(C)N=C=O	it appears as a clear colorless liquid with a pungent odor. Very toxic by ingestion, may also be toxic by skin absorption and inhalation. Vapors heavier than air. Less dense than water and insoluble in water. Vapors heavier than air. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion.

These are saponins in which the aglycone moiety is a steroid. The steroidal aglycone is usually a spirostane, furostane, spirosolane, solanidane, or curcubitacin derivative. it exists as a solid, slightly soluble (in water), and a very weakly acidic compound (based on its pKa). it has been found in human hepatic tissue tissue, and has also been primarily detected in urine. Within the cell, it is primarily located in the cytoplasm. Outside of the human body, it can be found in fenugreek and herbs and spices. This makes it a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products. 
14997	C1=CNC(=S)NC1=O	it is a nucleobase analogue that is uracil in which the oxo group at C-2 is replaced by a thioxo group. It has a role as an antithyroid drug and a metabolite. It is a thiocarbonyl compound and a nucleobase analogue. It derives from a uracil. it is a sulfur-containing uracil. An established antithyroid drug and highly selective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), thiouracil also covalently binds to dopaquinone, produced by tyrosinase catalyzed oxidation of tyrosine, thereby selectively accumulating in de novo-synthesized melanin in overactive melanin-producing cells and providing a means to localize melanoma cells.
