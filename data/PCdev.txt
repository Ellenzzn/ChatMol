10503	CC(C)C1=NN2C=CC=CC2=C1C(=O)C(C)C	it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE), mainly PDE-3, -4, -10, and -11, with anti-(neuro)inflammatory, vasorelaxant, bronchodilator, analgesic, neuroprotective and potential anti-tumor activities. it (IBD) is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Upon administration, IBD exerts its potential anti-tumor activity against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells by inhibiting PDE-4 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which results in a decrease in MIF, its receptor CD74, and AKT expression, and attenuates the immunosuppressive properties of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and reduces T-regulatory cells (Tregs). This causes GBM cell apoptosis and inhibits GBM cell proliferation. In addition, IBD reduces, through its inhibitory effect on various PDEs, the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL- 1beta, leukotriene B4, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). IBD also upregulates the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and promotes the production of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). It also blocks toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), inhibits nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and reduces the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also prevents platelet aggregation, causes cerebral vasodilation, bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, and improves cerebral blood flow. In addition, IBD attenuates the PDE-mediated activation of glial cells and abrogates PDE-mediated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. MIF is secreted by cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is highly expressed within GBM and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation. Co-expression of MIF and CD74 in GBM is associated with poor patient survival.

It works by inhibiting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), which are receptor tyrosine kinases that activate signalling pathways in tumour cells. FGFRs gained attention as potential therapeutic targets in selected cancers, as FGFR gene alterations were observed in a wide variety of cancers including those of the urinary bladder, breast, ovary, prostate, endometrium, lung, and stomach. Deregulated FGFR signalling pathway can lead the development of oncogenes and tumour-promoting physiological processes, such as cancer cell proliferation, enhanced angiogenesis, and evasion of cell death.  In April 2020, it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma in previously treated adult patients with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene fusion or other rearrangements as detected by an FDA-approved test. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most common primary malignancy affecting the biliary tract and the second most common primary hepatic malignancy. This malignancy accounts for 15% to 20% of primary hepatobiliary malignancies, which account for 13% of overall cancer-related global mortality. With increasing research on the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma and potential therapeutic targets for anticancer drug treatment, recent studies show that up to 45% of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma exhibited gene rearrangements resulting in oncogenic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFR2) fusion proteins. The FDA-approved indication for it was granted under accelerated approval based on the overall response rate and duration of response in pre-marketing clinical trials. it is marketed under the brand name Pemazyre, and it is available as oral tablets. it is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) types 1, 2, and 3 (FGFR1/2/3), with potential antineoplastic activity. it binds to and inhibits FGFR1/2/3, which may result in the inhibition of FGFR1/2/3-related signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation in FGFR1/2/3-overexpressing tumor cells. FGFR, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases upregulated in many tumor cell types, plays a key role in cellular proliferation, migration, and survival.

Direct agonists directly interact with the adrenergic receptors, whereas indirect agonists typically stimulate the release of endogenous catecholamines. The beta-2 adrenergic agonists act mainly on the smooth muscle of the vasculature, bronchial tree, intestines and uterus. These agents also act on the liver stimulating glycogenolysis and release of glucose from the liver and muscle (particularly if used in high doses). The beta-2 adrenergic agonists are used largely as bronchodilators in the management of asthma, both in control of acute symptomatic attacks as well as chronic, long term prevention and management. These agents are some of the most commonly prescribed drugs for asthma and are widely used and proven to be well tolerated and safe. The use of beta adrenergic agonists in asthma has not been associated with elevations in serum aminotransferase or alkaline phosphatase levels or in causing clinically apparent liver disease. When given in large doses or after intentional overdose, beta adrenergic agonists can cause liver injury. Most case reports of liver damage from these agents have been associated with their use in control of premature labor (for their effects on relaxation of uterine smooth muscle). The liver injury typically arises within a few days of starting high dose intravenous beta adrenergic agonists, is usually asymptomatic, not associated with jaundice, and rapidly reversed once the medication is stopped. Terbutaline Sulfate is the sulfate salt form of terbutaline, an ethanolamine derivative with bronchodilating and tocolytic properties. Terbutaline sulfate selectively binds to and activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to intracellular adenyl cyclase activation via a trimeric G protein and subsequent increase in cyclic cAMP production. Increased cAMP levels result in relaxation of bronchial and vascular smooth muscle mediated through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates proteins in control of muscle tone. cAMP also inhibits calcium ion release from intracellular stores, reduces calcium entry into cells and induces the sequestration of intracellular calcium all of which aids the relaxation of airway muscles. Terbutaline sulfate also increases mucociliary clearance and reduces release of inflammatory cell mediators.

At the same time, the FDA also approved the therascreen FGFR RGQ RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) for utilization as a companion diagnostic with it for selecting patients for the indicated therapy.  it's innovation lies in the fact that it is the first personalized treatment targeting susceptible FGFR genetic alterations for patients with metastatic bladder cancer, which demonstrates the design of it in developing more personalized and precision medicines with the capacity to target cancer treatment to a patient's specific genetic mutation. Considering urothelial cancer is statistically the fourth most common kind of cancer in the world, the introduction of it offers a welcome new option in the ever-expanding therapeutic tool kit to treat such prevalent medical conditions.  Nevertheless, although it was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and Accelerated Approval from the FDA so as to allow the agency to focus on and expedite the approval process for a medication indicated for a serious condition that fills an unmet medical need using clinical trial data that is believed to predict a genuine clinical benefit for patients with the given condition, such designations mean further ongoing clinical trials are necessary to confirm the clinical benefit of it going forward. it is an orally bioavailable, pan fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, it binds to and inhibits FGFR, which may result in the inhibition of FGFR-related signal transduction pathways and thus the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and tumor cell death in FGFR-overexpressing tumor cells. FGFR, upregulated in many tumor cell types, is a receptor tyrosine kinase essential to tumor cell proliferation, differentiation and survival.
